      <h2>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT</h2>
      <p class="solution-p"><br>Dyslexia can result in frustration, embarrassment, avoidance, and low self-esteem as a result of difficulties performing tasks that seem to come naturally to others. Demystifying the learning disorder with your child can help them develop the tools — and resilience — necessary to manage it, both in school and in social circumstances.</p>

      <h2>INVOLVE BODY MOVEMENT IN LEARNING</h2>
      <p class="uniqueness-p"><br>Children with dyslexia learn most easily through hands-on activities. They need manipulatives when solving math problems rather than relying on pencil and paper. When learning math concepts, for example, let them see and understand what is happening instead of giving them facts or rules to memorize.</p>

      <h2>ENCOURAGE THEM!</h2>
      <p class="toDo-p"><br>One of the best ways to support a child with dyslexia — or any child who is struggling — is to encourage those activities that they like and feel good at, whether it is music, joining a sports team or anything else that helps build their confidence.
<br>
To help reinforce that dyslexia is not a marker of intelligence, it can also be helpful to talk about successful people who have also been diagnosed with dyslexia.</p>
